# Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect phishing websites using machine learning techniques. By analyzing website features, we identify anomalies indicative of phishing attempts.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: Collected from PhishTank, MillerSmiles, and Googleâ€™s operators.
- **Techniques Used**: Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection.
- **Tools**: scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.

## Results
The model successfully identified phishing website characteristics, supported by visualizations and statistical analysis.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Phishing-Anomaly-Detection.git
cd Phishing-Anomaly-Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
